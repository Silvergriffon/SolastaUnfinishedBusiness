Subclass/&DomainNatureDescription=Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself; from inscrutable gods of the deep forests to friendly deities associated with particular springs and groves. Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.
